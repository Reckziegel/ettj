Title: Yield curve estimation via the two step method with decay parameters optimization
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Lucas Rubbo Tesser
Maintainer: The package maintainer <lcstesser@gmail.com>
Description: Estimates yield curve factor models, as described in Diebold and Li (2006), 
    Svensson (1994) and extensions. It produces accurate representations of empirical 
    zero-coupon yields while the factors can be interpreted as the level, slope and 
    curvature of term structure of the yield curve. The main advantadge this approach 
    is the ability to reduce a multi dimention problem into a few factors.
